WLM-stats
=======

Statistics retriever for Wiki Loves Monuments in Sweden.

Heavily based on [EuropeanaHarvest](https://github.com/lokal-profil/EuropeanaHarvest)
meaning there is still plenty of crud.

Does what it needs to but still a work in progress...

To run: "`python run.py` *`infile`*"
(where *infile* is a file in `/indata/`)
